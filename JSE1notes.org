* js-lang notes (CISCO JavaScript Essential 1)

** Module 1

*** Minimal Trio:
- Setting up JavaScript needs: Code Editor, Interpreter, and Debugger.
- Option to write program: Client side, Server side, Mobile

*** Tools maybe needed:
- Package managers: contain ready made solution
- Test runners and module bundlers: automate process (Grunt or Webpack)
- Testing framework: for error, correctness (Mocha, Jasmine, Jest)

*** VS Code
- Popular in web development
- Built-in JavaScript debugger, tools streamline web project

*** Web Storm
- Commercial development environment
- Supporting and testing

*** Best Debugger for JavaScript
- The Inspector, open browser
- The JavaScript Console, allows running JS commands
- The Debugger, special features for debugging

*** Console
Place where various messages are displayed, normally visible to the browser user

*** Function
- After the function name use open & close parentheses
- Arguments: data used during operation

*** The <script></script> tag
Use "src" when the code is repeatedly needed or too long  
To apply parallel (non-blocking JS code) to avoid freezing:
- Add "defer" when HTML is fully loaded
- Add "async" when it needs to be loaded immediately (doesn't need to wait for HTML file to finish download); executes as soon as the script is ready

*** Open HTML file on a browser or any file type (ctrl + O)

*** Variable
Most programming languages declare variables before using them, but in JS:
- Has no exception
- Name of the container for certain values
- To properly name the variable, you need to consider (size, color, stepCounter, and so on)
- Variable names consist of any sequence of letters (lower-case and upper-case)
- Strictly not start in digit
- Cannot use reserved keyword as a variable
- Mostly use "var" or "let"
  - "let" prevents declaring another variable with the same name
  - "var" allows redeclaration but is prone to errors

*** Constant
Preventing a value from being changed by mistake
- "const" is not a variable, it is a constant

*** Initialization
Receives value from another variable using its variable name

*** use strict ("use strict;")
Changes the behavior of the interpreter and follows modern JavaScript standards
- Must be used at the beginning of the code


*** Curly bracket/ program block
inside of it we can declare values even the previous variable has no values
- declaring "variable" inside the block: it will only matter inside the block
- Global: Variable outside the block is global
- Local: out it we called local
- The local can read the Global, but the Global cannot read the local
	- Can also be "Local" by simply declaration, but this technique will not work in function
	- variable "var" is different it can use everywhere (inside & outside)
	- but sometimes local depend on situation

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var globalGreeting = "Good ";
   
function testFunction() {
    var localGreeting = "Morning ";
    console.log("function:");
    console.log(globalGreeting);
    console.log(localGreeting);
}
   
testFunction();
   
console.log("main program:");
console.log(globalGreeting);
console.log(localGreeting); // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: localGreeting is not defined
#+END_SRC

*** Functions: Certain piece code that perform specific task
- parentheses: can contain parameters passed to the function
- mote use program block

** Introduction to JavaScript and Computer Programming

About JavaScript (how to communicate with the computer, what is JS, advantages and limitations of JS, where is JS used today)  
Setting up the programming environment (development tools, online development environment, local development environment)  
First JS program – Hello, World! (a few words about HTML, how to run your JavaScript code, executing the code directly in the console)

-----

** Module 2

Variables, Data Types, Type Casting, and Comments  
Variables (naming, declaring and initializing variables, declarations and strict mode, changing variable values, constants, scope)  
Primitive data types (Boolean, Number, BigInt, String, undefined, null, type casting – primitive construction functions and primitive conversions, implicit conversions)  
Complex data types (Object, Array, basic Array properties and methods)  
Comments (single-line comments, multi-line comments, documentation)

-----

** Module 3

Operators and User Interaction  
Assignment, arithmetic, and logical operators (what are operators, assignment operators, arithmetic operators, logical operators, compound assignment operators)  
Strings, comparison, and other JS operators (string concatenation and compound assignments, comparison operators, conditional operators, typeof, instanceof and delete operators, operator precedence)  
Interacting with the user (dialog boxes – alert, confirm, prompt)

-----

** Module 4

Control Flow – Conditional Execution and Loops  
Conditional execution (what is conditional execution, the if–else statement, the conditional operator, the switch–case statement)  
Loops (what are loops, the while loop, the do–while loop, the for loop, the for–of loop, the for–in loop, the break and continue statements)

-----

** Module 5

Functions  
Function basics (what are functions, declaring functions, calling functions, local variables, the return statement, function parameters, shadowing)  
Functions as first-class members (function expressions, passing a function as a parameter, callbacks)  
Arrow functions (declaring and calling)  
Recursion (basic idea)

-----

** Module 6

Errors, Exceptions, Debugging, and Troubleshooting  
Errors and exceptions – introduction (natural languages and communication errors, errors vs. exceptions, errors without exceptions, limited confidence)  
Basic types of errors in JS (SyntaxError, ReferenceError, TypeError, RangeError)  
Exception handling (the try–catch statement, the finally statement, the throw statement, and custom errors)  
Code debugging and troubleshooting (what is debugging, step-by-step execution, viewing and modifying variables, the step out option, measuring code execution time)
